"Title Got my first credit card around 2 years ago Now 2 years later I have Feb 2022 Discover It Unsecured Cannot PC to Discover CashBack For age history Nov 2022 Capital One Savor One Student Groceries Restaurants March 2023 Citi Custom Cash Gas 5 CB on highest spending category June 2023 Chase Freedom Flex Rotating categories card my foundation w Chase Anyone have good suggestions Hello everyone few questions EDIT my main question is this I guess ultimately what I m wondering is if credit card companies collect way more data than they are disclosing Like grouping cohorts as friends based on location data from swiping at the same bar or venmo transactions etc 2nd EDIT I guess I m more clueless than I thought I thought there would be some silos between competing company s regarding credit cards i e they all report to credit bureaus but didn t think they would share the granularity to identify groups on different platforms Well I guess everyone is on visa so maybe not so silo ed So I had two credit cards that had travel perks and free authorized users aa executive and venturex I added some close friends and family to give them access to lounges and priority pass Ended up canceling all AU on my executive because of the new fees in 2023 VentureX I kept my family and friends on My buddy was a victim of identify theft and he ran his credit report and saw the account that I opened for him I only entered his name and family names under the impression that the cards that would be received would be used as an extension of my credit Question how did they know that my buddy let s say John Smith was linked to me and John could see my balance I don t recall entering personal identifying information other than his name and his name is pretty damn common I don t think he ever used the credit card for any purchase as well Being a part of John s credit report does it help boost his credit score if my available credit bumps his available credit and lowers his utilization So I have read mixed things on the altitude reserve on what counts as a mobile wallet All the sales rep could do was read to me stating Apple Pay lg pay Samsung Pay and google pay None of these allow you to send to another person Is there a way to send these cards cash to another person via any of the wallets accepted Hi all Do charge cards affect your credit score differently than credit cards I am starting the process to get the Chase Trifecta setup however looking for advice to ensure things run smoothly For insight I have a vantage credit score of 743 and credit usage of 43 I only have debt from my mortgage plus two credit cards one being a starter visa card from my bank that I used in college card has been open for 11 years to establish credit and the second being the chase freedom flex I activated last week My student and personal loans have been paid in full for a few years now Looking for advice as to when I should apply for the remaining two cards freedom unlimited sapphire preferred to ensure little to no issues getting these remaining cards into my setup I am using the freedom flex currently to get the SUB then would like to get the SUBs for both the freedom unlimited and sapphire preferred once I have those cards How soon should I apply for the remaining cards and in which order should I apply for them Also how much time between the first card should then I apply for the final card Thanks in advance I just received a letter from Capital One saying I ve been approved for a credit card and will receive a welcome kit with my new card soon I did not apply for any credit card I just tried calling capital one but it says they are closed at the moment I ll have to try tomorrow What are things that I should do I checked my credit and it indeed says there was a hard credit check from capital one I ll call tomorrow and ask when this application was sent and how was it received via online application Do I also freeze my credit How exactly do I go about this Is this necessarily 100 identity theft Wouldn t they order the card to their address and not mine Which order would you put these in for how to best improve the card What 2 perks woulds make it an absolute 1 premium card 1 Top tier travel partners for airline hotel and car rentals including AIRBNB and Turo or similar services What about Uber and Lyft as travel partners Or would not be premium enough 2 Pooling CB points on all US Bank cards 3 Making the boost redeemable for all mobile wallet transactions including Walmart Target PayPal Venmo etc 4 Increasing the 50 boost to 100 4a Following BoA and offering increasing value the more you invest or borrow other products from them 5 Best purchase and travel protections and extended warranty available amongst all premium cards Just to make it fair for USB let s say they increase the AF by 50 adding 1 perk or 100 for 2 perks also increasing the 325 credit by half of the AF increase I am going to downgraded the Chase Sapphire Reserve card my wife and I use for a number of reasons I am going to be switching over to the Capital One Venture X card I want to downgrade to one of their no annual fee credit cards because I don t want to close the credit line but I can t decide which one to go to either Freedom Flex or Freedom Unlimited My other credit cards in case it s relevant Capital One SavorOne CapitalOne QuickSilver Apple Southwest Priority Amazon Prime Visa and Sam s Club World Elite I opened the card in January and had fraud alerts two times for adding the card to Apple Pay When calling they asked for phone numbers and none of them would work Then they would ask for a landline which I don t have After that they would ask for another Citi credit card and that wouldn t work so they had to resort to mail in verification Now fast forward to now I set a travel notice in the app for the card and as soon as I purchased something in another country I got another fraud alert They asked me for the same verification methods and none of them worked This time they also asked me for the last 6 digits of my account number used to pay the statement for the credit card which is suspicious Is this suspicious This is just so frustrating No wonder it s called shiti bank Hi everyone We just received the WF Active Cash Visa credit card but primary account holder is husband and I m the authorized user We applied online and there was no option for a joint account I didn t apply as primary because I have been a retired mom for many years don t have pay stubs to show proof of income which is required for this card However my spouse is currently employed and can produce the 2 latest pay stubs so it made sense for him to be the applicant online Recently a WF CSR over the phone says can also apply as joint account but has to be done in branch However she wasn t sure if current account can be converted to a joint Prefer to do the conversion if possible because don t want to go thru the hassle to re apply for a new account Does anyone know if existing single can be converted to joint account TIA of your responses I have just applied for active cash card and my credit score is 748 on Experian and 768 on Equifax and TransUnion Will I get an approval and how many days will it take for approval if i get the amazon prime visa and amazon prime cancel amazon prime as well as the visa do i keep the 100 giftcard as well as the 50 discount on an item im trying to purchase I want to ask what is the limit for student credit cards I usually see a limit of only 2000 3000 for a student credit card I just asked cap1 to increase the limit for my savorone student but they only increased the limit by 100 from 300 to 400 I usually use my card for more than 1000 and always pay on time My income is 42000 I currently am considering cancelling my Amex Gold for the Chase Sapphire preferred I ve had my Amex for 3 years but think I would get similar value from the preferred considering the lower annual fee Furthermore I have a feeling that the Amex being a charge card is not benefiting my credit score as much as a traditional credit card would Opened the Gold in February and planning on trying for the 175K Plat offer now Plan is to open an AMEX Everyday as well later in the year to have a place to keep my points Any concerns with closing both these cards within 3 months of each other next year once the AFs hits Hi everyone So my house just got some damages and will need to go through renovation very soon end of April Total estimated expenses come out to be around 40 45k We have a

not signed up any Biz CC using this EIN I also have a very good offer for SUBs on both my AMEX Plat Gold cards thus I can refer my fiance to sign up for both and hit the spending requirement easily on 2 new cards even though we don t really want to pay another 1000 for the annual fee for AMEX each year Can absolutely pay it off in 1 year or less just that we don t want to opt in for that option or minimize the amount of cash we have to pay immediately as much as possible We both own cars and are fully paid No housing mortgage Please advise us on what would be the best next move as the expenses are coming up very soon Thank you all in advance My apartment is literally on top of a Whole Foods which consequently leads me to shop there far more than I usually would I get all of my groceries there as well as other items And I use my AMEX gold exclusively there but feel like I could be getting substantially more value using the Amex Prime Visa 5 back at Whole Foods I buy many other things on Amazon as well I m a simple guy and just use my AMEX gold for everything but thinking I should just switch to Amazon Prime Visa since I already pay for Prime VentureX as a catch all Would this be a

next card CashBack Do you have any cards you ve been looking at Chase Freedom Unlimited Capital1 SavorOne Chase Sapphire Preferred Hi Everyone I recently used a 1 APY offer from Citi to transfer 4000 to my double cash Looking at my statement closed on Apr 18 for this period I have made 917 21 in purchases 120 in the transfer fee and 683 81 in payment to the previous statement the one that closed on Mar 20 My question is mainly concerned with the repayment on May 16 when my current statement is due If I wish to avoid the 27 APY for standard purchases while taking advantages of the 1 Balance Transfer to the fullest extent how much should I pay back Citi My understanding so far is that I would need to pay 917 21 120 1037 21 although I am not sure if a the 120 fee would be subject to the same 1 promotional APY and b whether there is some mandatory minimum payment for the balance transfer portion simular to a My Chase Plan for instance Since this is the first time I have performed a balance transfer I would really appreciate any guidance Thanks Y all Got business unlimited about 6 months ago and used the bonus I see business preferred about 80 000 bonus points Can I apply hit the bonus and than transfer points to business unlimited and close preferred Dont want to pay AF after one year So i have already stepped into the world of credit cards and it s been more than a year since I started off with my US Bank Altitude Go credit card and I also have an excellent credit score now at 749 and I am planning to take my benefits and cashback a step forward so I have been looking at the BLIT mastercard As my most expensive spending is on rent and some other credit card for overall spending most importantly gas and groceries but the question here is is it okay to apply for two credit cards at the same time and what should I do with my USB Go if I am not going to use it anymore I d like a new credit card for the SUB but I only want it in digital format My wallet is small and can only hold a few items and I m not really too down to have a Constanza wallet or to lock extras in a safe or something like that Are there any cards you know that are digital only I e for use with online retailers digital wallets etc Or should I just get a normal card and shred it once it arrives so it s effectively digital only I have a Citi AAdvantage card that I ve had open for years probably at least 10 years I was really only keeping it open to benefit my credit score but it has a 180 annual fee I probably haven t used the card in at least 2 years Any reason not to cancel it Current credit cards you are the primary account holder of Discover IT 4k limit 6 2020 Chase Freedom Flex 10k limit 7 2021 Citi Custom Cash 4 5k limit 12 2021 Ollo Optimum now Ally Unlimited Cash

SavorOne Chase Sapphire Preferred Hi Everyone I recently used a 1 APY offer from Citi to transfer 4000 to my double cash Looking at my statement closed on Apr 18 for this period I have made 917 21 in purchases 120 in the transfer fee and 683 81 in payment to the previous statement the one that closed on Mar 20 My question is mainly concerned with the repayment on May 16 when my current statement is due If I wish to avoid the 27 APY for standard purchases while taking advantages of the 1 Balance Transfer to the fullest extent how much should I pay back Citi My understanding so far is that I would need to pay 917 21 120 1037 21 although I am not sure if a the 120 fee would be subject to the same 1 promotional APY and b whether there is some mandatory minimum payment for the balance transfer portion simular to a My Chase Plan for instance Since this is the first time I have performed a balance transfer I would really appreciate any guidance Thanks Y all Got business unlimited about 6 months ago and used the bonus I see business preferred about 80 000 bonus points Can I apply hit the bonus and than transfer points to business unlimited and close preferred Dont want to pay AF after one year So i have already stepped into the world of credit cards and it s been more than a year since I started off with my US Bank Altitude Go credit card and I also have an excellent credit score now at 749 and I am planning to take my benefits and cashback a step forward so I have been looking at the BLIT mastercard As my most expensive spending is on rent and some other credit card for overall spending most importantly gas and groceries but the question here is is it okay to apply for two credit cards at the same time and what should I do with my USB Go if I am not going to use it anymore I d like a new credit card for the SUB but I only want it in digital format My wallet is small and can only hold a few items and I m not really too down to have a Constanza wallet or to lock extras in a safe or something like that Are there any cards you know that are digital only I e for use with online retailers digital wallets etc Or should I just get a normal card and shred it once it arrives so it s effectively digital only I have a Citi AAdvantage card that I ve had open for years probably at least 10 years I was really only keeping it open to benefit my credit score but it has a 180 annual fee I probably haven t used the card in at least 2 years Any reason not to cancel it Current credit cards you are the primary account holder of Discover IT 4k limit 6 2020 Chase
